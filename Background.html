            <p>NS&#38I is an investment and savings bank which is state owned by the UK government and was first formed back in 1861.
                Historically the aim of NS&#38I was to attract funds from individual savers in UK for the purpose of funding the government
                public sector. Since NS&#38I is a government owned organisation it offers quite a few services that are tax free, this
                differentiates NS&I from quite a few other savings companies that are located in the UK.</p>
