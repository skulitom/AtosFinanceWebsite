            <p>In the near future we are looking at creating a video that would demonstrate how our app could be used,
            to accomplish this we are going to use our app prototype in the progress. Here are some fo the most important
            aspects that we are looking to accomplish in the near future:

            <p>Our plan for the future is to start working on app development of our project. We are currently following agile development techniques and we will continue to do so throughout
                the project. All of our tasks will be done by the deadlines we set to ourselves in the gantt chart.

                Whilst developing the app we are going to have 3 week sprint terms after each of which we are going to show out progress to the client. So far all of our
                progress has been documented and is available for all of our team members on google drive so for the final project report we are going to constantly add any
                information that we may be missing.</p>

            <p>Of course it is impossible to predict the final version of our application before we even start our first sprint because of the very nature of agile development,
            However our designs and app prototype demonstrate roughly how exactly we imagine the end product to look. Our final version would have to satisfy our MoSCoW
            Must have requirements and at least most of the should have requirements as well.</p>
