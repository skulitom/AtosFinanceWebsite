            <h3>NS&I Mobile App and Premium Bond Pooling</h3>
            <hr>
            Our proposed solution is two-fold. One aspect is a new financial product: group owned premium bonds. The second aspect are the IT solutions:
            we will create an extension to NS&#38I&#39s web interface to facilitate the new financial product. Additionally, we will develop a mobile app
            that will allow users to interact with all features of their NS&I account,including our new product of premium bond pooling, from a smartphone or tablet.
            <h3>Rationale for Proposed Solution</h3>
            <hr>
            Having conducted a survey of our target demographic (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeF_gW6FjwgdyzOBNLAX8Fa1WLoGCgteYYQsh-V5IzLyTzkZA/viewform">Survey</a>) we learned that most of them had not heard of NS&#38I before. Moreover, many of them are students who have very little
            money to save. This, combined with the fact that many of them expressed interest in saving money in a pool with their friends or colleagues, inspired our group owned premium
            bond solution. We believe that the social aspect of the product will encourage users from the younger generation to invest in premium bonds and advertise NS&#38I&#39s products to
            their friends. Furthermore, we believe that this initial exposure to NS&#38I will make this user group more likely to continue to use NS&#38I&#39s products and features in the future.
            <br><br>

            We believe that the mobile app is a necessity in the current market. All major retail banks have a mobile app, and we believe this is a major disadvantage. 40% of millennials
            say they interact with their smartphones more than other people. 60% of millennials interact with their bank once a week. Thus there is a strong case for a mobile app that
            would facilitate more frequent and productive interaction between millennials and NS&#38I.

            <br><br>

            We had also considered other solutions such as a savings simulator that would be able show people first the benefits of savings and
            at the same time compare NS&#38Is products against others to educate people about what is in the market. Our reason for not picking
            this solution over what we picked is due to the difficult marketing nature of this product and lack of technological aspect to
            this solution as in addition to bringing in millennials NS&#38I also liked to digitalize their products in its entirety.
            <br><br>
            Another solution we had considered was also to create a new API extending NS&#38Is functionality to third party developers to allow
            a bigger audience to develop new creative solutions that would be better suited to millennials. Our reason for not going with this
            solution was due to its heavy reliance on NS&#38Is backend and also we were not sure on how much accessibility we would be granted
            due to the sensitive nature of the information. Our client was also not very comfortable in accepting this solution due to the
            impact on their backend even though he did mention that he liked the creativity in this idea.

            <h3>Demographic Analysis</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <b>Our user base is 18-34 year old people in the UK, i.e. Millenials</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Around 53% of students (18-22) have savings accounts.</li>
                    <li>The total number of HE enrolments at UK higher education institutions (HEIs) stood at <b>2,340,275</b> in 2012/13</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Student Loans:</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01079/SN01079.pdf">House of Commons Student Loan Statistics</a></li>

                </ul>
                From the sources above we managed to gather that around &#8356;10 Bn is loaned to students every year,
                At the end of 2014-15 total publicly owned debt for English students and EU students studying in England was &#8356;64.7 billion and
                at the end of 2014-15 a total of 2.7 million borrowers, 62% of the total, were liable for repayments.
                Perhaps the most important peace of information was that the typical English student faces debts of over &#8356;44,000 at graduation.

                <i>For this study Millennials are defined as 18 - 34 year olds</i>
                <br>
                <b>Reasons for saving:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>34% saving for holiday</li>

                    <li>27% to buy a house</li>
                </ul>

                60% of millenials interact with their bank at least once a week which is slightly higher compared to older age groups


                85% bank with traditional banks (HSBC, Santander etc.) rather than smaller &#34challenger banks&#34. This number is lower for older age groups


                Millenials are far more likely to be in the market for a bank than older generations

            <hr>
            <p>
                The purpose of the survey was to conduct an experiment using the information that we gathered from our demographic analysis
                The questions were constructed in a way that would allow us to construct a set of requirements that we would later on propose to the client.
                Overall we got a reasonable amount of responses totaling to 22, of course this is not a very large number however this was enough to
                get a relatively good idea of the needs of our surveyed demographic.

            <h3>Design Aspects</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
            There are several design aspects that must be acknowledged in order to make our application as easy to use as possible.
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplicity</li>
                    <li>Visibility</li>
                    <li>Consistency</li>
                    <li>Feedback</li>
                </ul>
            Lets first consider <b>simplicity</b>, if there is too much information given to the user at one time, the user may find the amount
            of information intimidating and will likely stop using the app in the near future. To avoid this problem when designing the app
            there should be as less text as possible, especially labels as everything should be made intuitive to the end user.
            <br><br>
            <b>Visibility</b> concerns how visible certain aspects of the application are. This may be the placement of certain buttons in obvious
            and easy to find places or this could also be the contrast between text and background.Text written in colors that are too similar to each other will
            be difficult for a regular user to read and may be impossible for a person that is colorblind. Applications that are difficult for the user to navigate
            because of irregular button placements would take them too long to understand and ultimately they may switch to using a different service.
            <br><br>
            The application should be <b>consistent</b> in order for the application to be both simple and visible. One aspect of consistency is the layout of the app
            a consistent layout allows a user to better assume the positions of elements of importance much better which leads to learning the app much quicker.
            <br><br>
            <b>Feedback</b> is important as it acknowledges actions made by the user. Actions that are not acknowledged would most likely lead to the user doing the same thing many times
            (i.e. misunderstandings between the user and the application) ultimately leading to a result that they were not expecting.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Design</h3>
