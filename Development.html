            <hr>
            <p>
                Our financial product, group owned premium bonds, must be realised fully through an extension of NS&#38I&#39s web interface to facilitate all relevant interaction with this new product. Additionally there must be functionality within the mobile app to facilitate some, if not all of these same interactions.
<br><br>

                We must deliver a mobile app which offers most, if not all the features of a modern banking app. Features will include: logging in to a user account, checking savings accounts, starting new accounts, buying and checking sole owned premium bonds, and managing group owned premium bonds.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <p>We have decided to use git as our version control system, there are many reasons o why we came to such a decistion:
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone in the team is familiar with it</li>
                <li>There is a lot of information about it</li>
                <li>Intergration with IDE&#39s</li>
                <li>Privacy</li>
            </ul>
            For the actual project we have setup a private repository which no one has access to apart from our team members.
            This was done to create this app confidentially.

            <h3>SQLite</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>From all of our conversations with the client it looks like we are not going to have access to the
            NS&#38I&#39s backend. This would not be possible as it is essentialy a bank that stores very private information.
            SQLite will allow us to simulate NS&#38I&#39s backend so that our application would later on be intergrated
            into their system by their onsite engineers.</p>
