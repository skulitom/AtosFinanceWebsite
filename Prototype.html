            <hr>
            <p>After collating our data from the survey and interviews, we set out to create personas for how we imagined the users of the app will be based on the results. At the same time we also created scenarios as to where and how will they be using the app. The advantages of taking such an approach was to better understand the users and come up with additional features to the app to make it more attractive to the public. Hence, with our requirements document having gone through may iterations we began designing sketches of the app based on the document and based on that built the prototype. Some of the problems that we caught during our initial stages was the inability to buy premium bonds through their app, app focused merely on premium bonds and a very dark interface. As you can see in our prototype we tackled this with the addition of all accounts functionality into one app where users can manage all their accounts and also open up other accounts within the comfort of their home. With the dull interface we tackled it with adding a mixture of colours among all pages each colour actually denoting a type of service as showed on their website. For example, yellow indicates Premium Bonds and orange indicates Income Bonds. We felt this made the design very intuitive and will appeal to the younger generation, that would discard a bank based on their app, addressing NS&#38Is initial problem.
                <br><br>
                To give a short run through of the app, we begin at the login page which when we implement a proof of concept of the app will have proper security but for now you can just click log in and will be redirected to the home page. Here at the home page having easy access in mind we show a brief summary of all the users accounts, type and balance, which can easily be clicked to gain more information. If you click on the direct saver, you will be directed to your account page where you will be able to see past transactions, make deposits/withdrawals, transfer money from this product to another and check your account details. Clicking back will bring you back to the home page where you will be able to access the menu that gives you access to all part of the app. The accounts page is similar to the home page in the sense that it display all your accounts information and will allow to access each one to manage it. Another page in the app is the products page where users can go and learn about NS&#38Is products and also sign up for said products through the app. This allows NS&#38Is to be digital in its entirety.
